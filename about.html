            <h1 class="h1-about">Know Us</h1>
            <p>We are a team of Computer Science students with a shared passion for both technology and the natural world. "Weather Insights" was created with a simple goal: to make weather information more accessible, reliable, and engaging. As future engineers, we believe that technology has the power to turn complex data into valuable knowledge that everyone can use in their daily lives.</p>
            <p>Our journey began with a curiosity about how weather forecasting works and a desire to bridge the gap between raw data and practical use. Each of us brings unique skills and perspectives to this project—from programming and design to a fascination with meteorology. Together, we’re committed to building a platform that informs, educates, and inspires, driven by the belief that informed communities are resilient communities.</p>
            <p>Our website is designed not just to report the weather but to deepen understanding. From explaining the science behind predictions to exploring how weather impacts our environment, "Weather Insights" aims to be your go-to resource for all things weather-related.</p>

            <h1 class="h1-about">Impact we Hope</h1>
            <p>We hope "Weather Insights" will empower people to make better-informed choices by understanding weather patterns and conditions. By making the science of weather prediction more approachable, we aim to inspire an appreciation for the forces of nature that shape our world.</p>
            <p>Beyond providing daily forecasts, "Weather Insights" seeks to highlight the broader significance of weather on our lives and communities. We delve into how weather affects our health, safety, agriculture, and travel, helping users see the connection between weather patterns and essential daily activities. Our platform encourages users to engage with weather data in ways that not only prepare them for today but also contribute to a more informed outlook on the future.</p>
            <p>Through accessible weather information, we aspire to foster a deeper connection with our environment and support proactive decision-making, whether it’s preparing for storms, planning outdoor events, or understanding climate change’s effects on our local areas. By enhancing awareness, "Weather Insights" aims to create a positive ripple effect, empowering individuals and communities to navigate and appreciate the dynamic world around us.</p>
